The main goal of the project is the implementation of a 2D virtual world simulator. The virtual
world should have the structure of a two-dimensional NxM grid. In this world, simple life
forms will exist, each with different behavior depending on its species. Every organism
should occupy exactly one cell of the world's 2D grid array. Each cell can contain no more
than a single organism at a time (in case of a collision, one of the organisms should be
removed from this cell). An option to save, in a csv file (save.csv), the game's status and be able to reload and resume it later on.
